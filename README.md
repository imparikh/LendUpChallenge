# LendUpChallenge
Coding challenge for Lend Up

I didn't separate the phases, but instead treated them as steps to achieve the final product. Due to this very process, you will find the homepage of my app at the awkward url of http://162.243.232.192/phaseTwo/. However, it works fine.

Simply type in the number (starting with 1) in the first input field, and the amount of second delay in the next field. Hit submit, and it'll take you to a waiting page. Check your phone in X amount of seconds, and you should get a call!

Want to replay it? No problem! Hit replay on whatever row you want.

I apologize for the table already having some rows filled in; this was necessary for testing purposes.

To load up your own Twilio credentials, first clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/imparikh/LendUpChallenge
```
Edit the config.txt file so that the first line is the account id, the second the authentication token, and the last one the Twilio number with the 1 (like 19084567890).
